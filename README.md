# Paul Estala

My portfolio website. You can see it at [estalapaul.me](https://estalapaul.me).

## Stack

Built using Laravel + React + Inertia.js + TailwindCSS.

## Tests

The tests use Laravel Dusk, so don't forget to install the chrome driver with: `php artisan dusk:chrome-driver` to be able to run them. Once installed, you can run `composer test` to run all the tests. Remember you have to have the laravel dev server running.
